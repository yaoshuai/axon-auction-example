# Auction House Example Application for Axon #

This project is dedicated to the development of a full-fledged "Auction House" example application with the [Axon Framework](http://code.google.com/p/axonframework/).

## Goals ##
  * Domain Driven Design ([DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design))
  * Command-Query Responsibility Segregation ([CQRS](http://www.udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/)) with the [Axon Framework](http://code.google.com/p/axonframework/)
  * Easy enough to understand
  * Big enough to have a full-flavored domain model
  * Clear separation of concerns (Command Server, Query Server ...)
  * Clear layer separation (No domain objects on clients...)
  * Anyone interested can participate
  * Website with live demo
  * Use cases from [Oracle/Sun's Auction House Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/JDCBook/proj2.html)
